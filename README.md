08/16/2025: I submitted my website for critique late and so it doesn't look like I will be getting any feedback from my peers. After pushing it to GitHub, I did notice some typos and grammar issues, so I worked on fixing those. I also see that in my navigational links on the top right, I tried to make them look like tabs, attached to the hero background but couldn't get it to line up right and also somehow managed to make the 'Home' tab slighlty higher than the rest? Weird. I will be working on fixing those items. 

I'm not sure if I like the navigational menu bar where it is at all, I might try moving it around and see if I can find a better look for it. 

It's hard to critique my own website because, of course, I think it's awesome!
