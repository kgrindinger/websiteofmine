08/16/2025: I submitted my website for critique late and so it doesn't look like I will be getting any feedback from my peers. After pushing it to GitHub, I did notice some typos and grammar issues, so I worked on fixing those. I also see that in my navigational links on the top right, I tried to make them look like tabs, attached to the hero background but couldn't get it to line up right and also somehow managed to make the 'Home' tab slighlty higher than the rest? Weird. I will be working on fixing those items. 

I'm not sure if I like the navigational menu bar where it is at all, I might try moving it around and see if I can find a better look for it. 

It's hard to critique my own website because, of course, I think it's awesome!

08/21/2025: Got some good peer feedback, cleanud up margins and paddings accordingly. Made sure alignments are looking slick, labeled CSS. One person mentioned having my song auto-play and I am not going to do that because I hate going to a site and having a song start out of the blue without warning, it startles me and I don't like that so I won't do that. She also metioned the size of the audio file could be smaller. No one else made this comment and I will be removing this item once the project is graded, so I'm not worried about it right now. 

Continued - went to bed with everything looking grand, but woke to find the Tips & Guides page to be seriously out of whack. Like gremlins got in overnight and messed with the borders or paddings or margins or something. I could not get it back to how it looked. After much finagaling, I decided to just remove that page for now. It's not really that useful and you can find the same information throught trip reports and links on other pages.
