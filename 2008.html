          <h2><u>2008 - First Solo Trip to London:</u></h2>
          <br>
          Welcome to my obsession with London! This is where it all started.
          <br>
          <br>
          Because I had listed a detailed trip report on Trip Advisor, I am going to post links to it here. I'd prefer
          to
          rewrite it, but I think it shows how young and naive I was. The excitement I had at everything I saw and
          experienced comes through in the writing. It was not only my first solo trip, it was also my first
          international
          trip. It is a long read and I hope you stick with me through it. You'll have to prove you're human once you
          click on the link.
          <br />
          <br />
          I flew British Airways, flight 48, Sea-Tac International to London Heathrow. Return: flight 49, LHR to SEA.
          This
          route is still running to this day and is my favorite route, I will pick this over others if I can. If
          no airline is mentioned in the trip page, I flew this BA route. I will mention other airlines when used. 
          <br />
          <br />
          There are several things I need to remind you dear reader about. This was 2008 - mobile phones were still
          infants, there really wasn't Internet available for free in hotels, and if it was the quality was lacking.
          You
          couldn't just access Apple or Google maps on your phone, there wasn't wifi available everywhere. And IF your
          mobile phone had a camera, its quality was crap. It was different times!
          <br />
          <br />
          This being my first trip, I used the Trafalgar tour company to book a 7-day independent tour, (which is no
          longer
          available with them). Basically, they
          booked the hotel for you, transfers from-to Paddington Station and gave you some vouchers, one for a theater
          ticket, another for the Hop-On, Hop-Off bus (which I didn't use) and there was at least one other but I
          don't
          recall what it was. I knew I was going to stay for longer than a week and extending my stay through the Ibis
          was
          more money than I could afford. Remember, this was 2008! I used Priceline in the hopes I would "win" the
          Ibis
          but wound up at the Hilton London, Olympia for the additional days.
