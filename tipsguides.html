      <ul>
        <li>Do - Be respectful.  </li>
        <li>Do - Wear whatever shoes you want, don't spend you trip nursing sore, blistery feet like I did.</li>
        <li>Do - Plan and buy tickets ahead of time if you can, it will save time spent standing in line. </li>
        <li>Do - Be ready to throw plans to the side if something goes wrong or something better comes along.</li>
        <li>Do - Have the fish and chips!</li>

      <ul>
        <li>Don't - Worry about looking like a tourist. You ARE one, don't worry about it!</li>
        <li>Don't - Jump the line ("queue")</li>
        <li>Don't - Stress about things you missed or didn't have time for. They're not going anywhere and it gives you a starting point for your journey back. </li>
        <li>Don't - Eat at a restaurant you can have at home. I've done it, I admit, but try some local places. Especially look for an Indian and/or fast-food chains i.e. <a href="https://www.nandosperiperi.com/"> Nando's</a> you don't see at home.</li>

        <ul>
            <li>The best place to help plan your trip to London, is the <a
                    href="https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowForum-g186338-i17-London_England.html">Trip Advisor London
                    Forum</a>. As you have seen, I used it exclusively and even met some friends on there. I cannot
                express how helpful and gracious that forum is. Try to Google things first, obviously, but if you're
                stumped or want the forum to look at your plans and tell if it seems feasible to do in a day or two or
                whatever, they are the best!</li>
            <li>I know we can and do use our phones for everything these days, but if you like actual maps or want a
                back-up in case something happens to your phone, check out this guide book - it is awesome. It includes
                underground and bus information which I found to be so rewarding.<a

                    target="_blank">üìñ Map Booklet</a></li>
            <li>Please, don't stop in the middle of the sidewalk to have a meeting or take photos or look at your maps.
                You have to remember that London is home to a lot of people, first and foremost. They are all around you
                just trying to get to work or home or to the pub. Be kind, move to the side first so that pedestrian
                traffic can continue to flow.</li>
            <li>When using the undergound, on the escalators - unless you would rather run up and down the escalator
                stairs, stand to your RIGHT. This allows people who want to run up and down to be able to do so. If you
                forget, you will here "Behind you" or even "on your left" - which is proper British for - move to the right.</li>
            <li>Keep a digital copy of your passport</li>
            <li>Try to carry a reusable water bottle, London has plenty of places you can fill it up</li>
            <li>Download offline maps before you go - just in case!</li>
