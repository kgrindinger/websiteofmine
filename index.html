      <p>Ever wanted to travel but have no one to go with? It's time to stop waiting and go by yourself! Back in 2008, I
        decided I wanted to vist London and it finally occured to me that if I continue to wait for someone to want or
        be
        willing to go with me, I could be waiting forever. So, I booked my flight and took off on my first solo trip and
        I've not looked back since!</p>
      <p>Each city or country listed below will lead to its own separate page where you can read about what I did, who I
        flew, where I stayed, what I ate and the ups and downs of being an introverted solo traveler. </p>
      <ul>
        <li><a href="index2.html">London, UK</a></li>
        <li>Amsterdam, The Netherlands</li>
        <li>Paris, France (not solo)</li>
        <li>Edinburgh, Scotland</li>

              mind.

      <p>I've been wanting to do this website for ages so I'm glad to have this medium to pursue it. Also, if I ever go
        live
        with it, I will take my name out and only sign off with my well known user name of rokrchik. Footer below is for
        in
